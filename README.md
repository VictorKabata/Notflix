# Notflix

# üõ†Ô∏èMigrating to KMP - [Develop Branch](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)

An android and desktop app built using [Kotlin Multiplatforom](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) that consumes [TMDB API]("https://developers.themoviedb.org/3") to display current trending, upcoming and popular moviesüçø and tvshowsüé¨.

[Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) is a framework of Kotlin that allows for sharing of a single codebase for business logic across different [targets](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-dsl-reference.html#targets)/platforms. Some of the targets supported by kotlin are: Android, iOS, Kotlin/JVM, Kotlin/JS, Android NDK, Windows, Linux, macOS etc.

[Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-mpp/) is a UI framework made by Jetbrains that allow for simple and accelerated desktop application and web development using [compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose). Compose multiplatform also allows sharing compose UI code between diffrent platforms. eg android, desktop(Windows, Linux, MacOS) and web.

## Prerequisite

// ToDo

## Running

Set up the `local.properties` file in the project's root directory (if it doesn't already exist) by adding the following properties:

```properties
api_key=<YOUR TMDB API KEY>
```

Run with the following command:

```bash
./gradlew run
```

## Pros of KMP/KMM

- Faster development since you only need to write most of the business logic and tests only once.
- Improve code quality.
- Highly maintainable and testable code due to separation of concern in the codebase.

## App Structure

<p align="center"><img src="assets/project_structureee.png" alt="Project Structure"></p>

The project currently has 3 main modules:

### 1. [androidApp](https://github.com/VictorKabata/Notflix/tree/main/androidApp)

This module contains the android application's UI built using [Jetpack compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).

### 2. [desktopApp](https://github.com/VictorKabata/Notflix/tree/main/desktopApp)

This module contains the desktop application's UI built using [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-mpp/).

## 3. [iOSApp](https://github.com/VictorKabata/Notflix/tree/main/iOSNotflix)
This module contains iOS code that holds the iosApp  UI built using [Swift UI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/)


### 4 . [shared](https://github.com/VictorKabata/Notflix/tree/main/shared)
This module contains shared code that holds the domain and data layers and some part of the presentation logic ie.shared viewmodels


### __Domain__

This is the core layer of the application. The ```domain``` layer is independent of any other layers this means that changes in other layers will have no effect on domain layer eg. screen UI (presentation layer) or changing database (data layer) will not result in any code change withing domain layer.

Components of domain layer include:

- __Models__: Defines the core structure of the data that will be used within the application.

- __Repositories__: Interfaces used by the use cases. Implemented in the data layer.

### __Data__

The ```data``` layer is responsible for selecting the proper data source for the domain layer. It contains the implementations of the repositories declared in the domain layer.

Components of data layer include:

- __Models__

  -__Dto Models__: Defines POJO of network responses.

  -__Entity Models__: Defines the schema of the database.

- __Mappers__: They perform data transformation between ```domain```, ```dto``` and ```entity``` models.

- __Network__: This is responsible for performing network operations eg. defining API endpoints using [Ktor](https://ktor.io/).

- __Cache__: This is responsible for performing caching operations using [Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin).

- __Data Sources__:  Responsible for deciding which data source (network or cache) will be used when fetching data and presenting the data to viewmodels.

<p align="center"><img src="assets/clean_arch.png" alt="Clean Architecture Diagram"></p>

### __Presentation__

The `presentation` package contains shared viewmodels code.
