Notflix is a [Kotlin Multiplatform]((https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html)) app that demonstrates cross-platform development using a single codebase and [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-mpp) for a consistent UI across Android, iOS and desktop(Linux, Windows & macOS) devices.

It consumes the TMDB API to fetch movie data and display it on all platforms.

> [!note]
This repository is under constant development/refactor since the project is designed to showcase the basics of Kotlin/Compose Multiplatform and is not intended for production use

## Getting Started

### Prerequisite

- [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/?er=221886) - Required for Android development.
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) - For Android development and project management.
- [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) - For iOS development and project management.
- [Kotlin Multiplatform Plugin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-plugin-releases.html?_gl=1*130bj1*_gcl_au*MTk1MDYwOTc4MS4xNzIxNjMzNjAy*_ga*MTM4NzQwMTA3NS4xNjk3NDg5MzQ5*_ga_9J976DJZ68*MTcyMzExNTUwNy43Ni4xLjE3MjMxMTU1OTYuNDQuMC4w#release-details)- In Android Studio, select Settings/Preferences | Plugins, search Marketplace for Kotlin Multiplatform, and then install it.

### Installation
- Clone the repository from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VictorKabata/Notflix.git
```

To install the __android__ application:
- Open the project in Android Studio and connect your android device/emulator.
- Configure the TMDB API key in the `local.properties` file.
```properties
api_key=<YOUR TMDB API KEY>
```
- Sync the Gradle project to download dependencies.
- Run the gradle command below from Android Studio terminal to build and install the android application on the connected android device/emulator:
```bash
./gradlew installDebug
```

To install the __iOS__ application:
- Open the __iOS__ project from XCode and connect your iOS device/emulator.
- Run the project.

To install the __desktop__ application:
- Open the project in Android Studio and run the gradle command below to build and install the application on the desktop:
```bash
gradlew desktopRun
```

## Project Structure

The application has two main modules:
1. composeApp: This is the core module containing the shared Kotlin Multiplatform code for network, caching, and UI logic.
  - __androidMain__: Contains Android-specific code, primarily serving as an entry point for the Android application. This directory includes the MainActivity class, application-level configuration, and Android-specific dependencies or initialization.

  - __iOSMain__: Contains iOS-specific code, primarily serving as an entry point for the iOS application. This directory includes the ContentView class, application-level configuration, and iOS-specific initialization for Koin.

  - __desktopMain__: Contains desktop-specific code, primarily serving as an entry point for the desktop application. This directory includes the main application class, window creation, and desktop-specific dependencies or initialization.
  - __commonMain__: Contains the core business logic, data access, and UI components that are shared across all platforms.
    - __domain__: This package houses the domain layer, which defines the business logic and entities of the application. It typically includes interfaces, data classes, and utils.
    - __data__: This package houses the data layer, which is responsible for fetching and caching data. It might include repositories, data sources, and network clients.
    - __ui__: This package houses the UI components that are shared across all platforms. These components can be implemented using Compose Multiplatform, allowing for a consistent user experience.
    - __di__: Contains the dependency injection setup, managing the creation and provision of dependencies throughout the application.

2. appiOS:  This module houses the iOS-specific app code, serving as the entry point for the iOS application, providing the necessary configuration and integration with the shared _composeApp_ module.
